vim-erlang-tags
===============

The idea
--------

`vim-erlang-tags` **creates a tags file** (from Erlang source files), which can
be used by Vim.

When using Exuberant ctags or etags, the genereted tags will contain function
names, but there will be no `module:function` tags. This is a problem
because if several functions (in different modules) have the same name, the
text editor will not know which one to jump to.

The idea of this script is to generate `module:function` tags too. This way the
code will be **easier to navigate than with ctags or etags**. The original idea
is from László Lövei.

Since `:` is not a keyword character when editing Erlang files in Vim, this
repository also contains a Vim plugin, which modifies the following normal mode
commands to add `:` to the `iskeyword` option for Erlang files while they are
jumping to the location of the tag that is under the cursor:

    CTRL-]
    g<LeftMouse>
    <C-LeftMouse>
    g]
    g CTRL-]

Installation
------------

With [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen):

- `cd ~/.vim/bundle` and clone this repository.

Manually:

- Clone this repository.
- Add the following line to your `.vimrc` (replace the path with your own):

        :set runtimepath^=/path/to/vim-erlang-tags

Usage
-----

Let's say you would like to use tags for your Erlang project.

### Generate tags

First you need to generate the tags.

You can do that either in the command line:

    $ cd /path/to/my_erlang_project
    $ /path/to/vim-erlang-tags/bin/vim-erlang-tags.erl

Or within Vim by executing the following command:

    :ErlangTags

Note that for the latter command, the current working directory will be used
(`:help pwd` to find out more).

### Options

#### g:erlang_tags_ignore

default: not exists.
Add ignore path for tags generation. Use string or a list of string like:

let g:erlang_tags_ignore='rel'
let g:erlang_tags_ignore=['rel']

#### g:erlang_tags_auto_update

default: not exists

if exist and set to 1, this plugin will be triggered when an erlang buffer is wirtten.
Warrning: this may cost lots of cpu if you have a large project, use it on you own risk

#### g:erlang_tags_outfile

default: not exists

If you don't set, the default output path will be `.`


### Automating generating tags

To keep the tags file up-to-date you can re-run these commands periodically, or
automate the process by creating a commit/checkout hook or a crontab entry.

If you use Git, creating a checkout hook is simple:

    echo '#!/bin/bash' > .git/hooks/post-checkout
    echo '/path/to/vim-erlang-tags/bin/vim-erlang-tags.erl' > .git/hooks/post-checkout
    chmod +x .git/hooks/post-checkout
    cp -i .git/hooks/post-checkout .git/hooks/post-commit

### Make Vim use the tags

Add the following line to your `.vimrc`:

    :set tags^=/path/to/my_erlang_project/tags

This will explicitly add the `tags` file to the list of known tags locations.

Reopen Vim or just execute `:source $MYVIMRC` – now all your function names,
records, macros and file names are available with the Vim tag search commands.

### Using the Vim tag search commands

The few most useful tag search commands are the following:

- `CTRL-]`: jump to the definition of the function/record/macro under the cursor
- `:tj ident`: jump to the definition of `ident` (function/record/macro name)

For more information on those commands, see `:help tagsrch.txt`.
